The data files found in this repo are used to create visualizations in Observable. The visualizations can be easily access through the following collection on ObservableHQ: [https://observablehq.com/collection/@naazs03/dc-3](https://observablehq.com/collection/@naazs03/dc-3)

The Observable visualizations where the data files can be used are:

The visualizations were meant to be used with the all-nodes.csv file, however the smaller data files can be easier to work with and see on Observable.
