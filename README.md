The data files found in this repo are used to create visualizations in Observable.

The Observable visualizations where the data files can be used are:

[https://observablehq.com/@naazs03/amazon-product-categories-icicle-no-interaction](https://observablehq.com/@naazs03/amazon-product-categories-icicle-no-interaction)

[https://observablehq.com/@naazs03/amazon-product-categories-icicle-zoomable-and-highlight-s](https://observablehq.com/@naazs03/amazon-product-categories-icicle-zoomable-and-highlight-s)

The visualizations were meant to be used with the all-nodes.csv file, however the smaller data files can be easier to work with and see on Observable.
